Answer:
1)we can factor the number 15 with quantum computers. We can also factor the number 15 with a dog trained to bark three times - Robert Harley
2)euler would probably enjoy that now his theorem becomes a corner stone of crypto - Annonymous on Euler's theorem
3)the nice thing about Keeyloq is now we cryptographers can drive a lot of fancy cars - Dan Boneh
4)the ciphertext produced by a weak encryption algorithm looks as good as ciphertext produced by a strong encryption algorithm - Philip Zimmermann
5)you don't want to buy a set of car keys from a guy who specializes in stealing cars - Marc Rotenberg commenting on Clipper
6)there are two types of cryptography - that which will keep secrets safe from your little sister, and that which will keep secrets safe from your government - Bruce Schneihu      
7)there are two types of cyptography: one that allows the Government to use brute force to break the code, and one that requires the Government to use brute force to break the code.
8)we can see the point where the chip is unhappy if a wrong bit is sent and consumes more power from the environment - Adi Shamir
9)a (private-key)  encryption scheme states 3 algorithms, namely a procedure for generating keys, a procedure for encrypting, and a procedure for decrypting. 
10)The Concise OxfordDictionary (2006) de   nes crypto as the art of  writing o r solving codes.

target ciphertext: "the secret message is: When using a stream cipher, never use the key more than once"
